# Gameplay/Visual Features
Legacy4J introduces several fundamental gameplay and in-game visual changes to match the experience provided by the Legacy Console Edition.

## Legacy Crafting and Creative Menus
The Crafting System and Creative Inventory as of the latest versions of LCE has been fully implemented. <br>
By default, this is limited to the tabs used in LCE, but can be extended (without a resource pack) using:
- `Operator Items Tab` - Same as vanilla, adds a tab with operator items such as the Command Block, Light blocks and Barrier blocks.
- `Mod Crafting Tabs` - Adds tabs with recipes provided by external mods
- `Display Vanilla Tabs` - Adds tabs from the vanilla Recipe Book or Creative Inventory
- `Search Creative Tab` - Adds a search tab to the Creative Inventory

<sub> To navigate between these, use `Shift`+`Left Arrow`/`Right Arrow` or the Right Stick on your gamepad. </sub>

To extend these menus further using resource packs, refer to [Listing-Based Manager](./listing-based-manager)

## Resource Albums
Resource pack profiles that can function similarly to the LCE Texture Packs. <br>
For more information, see [Resource Pack Management](./resource-pack-management)

## Host Options
If you are the host of a world, regardless of whether of not `Host Privileges` is available, you will have access to `Host Options`.
- This is available by pressing the `H` key by default, or `Back` on gamepad, then pressing `Host Options`
- This gives you access to various gamerules, [common options](#legacy4j-common-options) and various mixins
- If `Host Privileges` is enabled, you will also have access to more gamerules, as well as time and weather control.

## LCE-style Mipmaps and Block Rotations
Using [FactoryAPI](/mods/factoryapi/overview#player-features), the distant textures are scaled with Nearest Neighbor scaling, and random block rotations can be toggled. <br>
These options combine to give the game a bit of that iconic look!

By default, [Random Block Rotations](/mods/legacy4j/configuration#random-block-rotations-factoryapi) is disabled, and [Nearest Mipmap Scaling](/mods/legacy4j/configuration#nearest-mipmap-scaling-factoryapi) is enabled. <br> You can find these under [`Advanced Graphics`](/mods/legacy4j/configuration#advanced-graphics) options, and can also be found in the FactoryAPI mod options.

# Legacy4J Options
Options applied through the `config/legacy/client_options.json`, available in `Advanced Game Options`
## Save Cache
Save Cache is used to add the manual saving functionality seen in Xbox One and PlayStation 4 Editions of LCE. <br>
This means that autosaving can be toggled off in the Pause Menu, or by setting the Autosave Interval to OFF. <br>
Unless `Fake Autosave Screen` (`Advanced User Interface`) is enabled, this is done without interruption, like in vanilla Java Edition.

This can be disabled by:
- Toggling the `Save Cache` option in `Advanced Game Options`
- Joining a multiplayer server
- Playing a world created in Hardcore Mode

### Save Cache - Troubleshooting
If you have `Save Cache` enabled and a world in your `saves` directory looks corrupted, check the `currentWorld` folder in case a copy of the world is still there. If so, copy it back to the `saves` directory.

## Legacy Creative Block Placing
Creative block placement from LCE has been implemented. This allows block placement to match your flight speed.

# Legacy4J Common Options
Options applied through the `config/legacy/common.json`, available in `Advanced Game Options`, or `Host Options` when in-game
## Legacy Combat
Legacy Combat enables the combat system used prior to Java Edition's Combat Update, and currently used on Bedrock Edition. <br>
- This changes how many of the attributes are displayed to visually match LCE:
![Tooltips with and without Legacy Combat](./images/combat-tooltips.png)
- Damage values have been reduced to match either LCE or Bedrock
- Sweep attacks are still available, but requires any level of the Sweeping Edge enchantment
This is controlled by the `legacyCombat` common option, 

## Legacy Sword Blocking
Legacy Sword Blocking enables the sword blocking mechanic available prior to Java Edition's Combat Update.
- This can be toggled separately from Legacy Combat, meaning you can have sword blocking with modern combat
- Like other item actions, the off-hand has priority, so using a shield, for example, is still possible if held in the off-hand

## Squared View Distance
Squared View Distance allows chunks on the edge of Render Distance to render in a square shape, rather than a circle.

# Gamerules
These gamerules can be toggled and adjusted in `Existing World/Create New World > More Options > Game Options` or in `Host Options`
## Legacy Flight
The Creative flight from LCE has been fully implemented.
- Flying no longer maintains momentum, so you can stop much faster
- Sprint flight is much faster than in vanilla
- Non-sprint flight is 8-directional, making alignment during building much easier
- Slow flying is 4-directional
This is controlled by the `legacyFlight` gamerule.

## Legacy Swimming
Swimming from Update Aquatic and newer versions of LCE have been implemented.
- Swimming can be invoked when looking below the horizon line
- Swimming can be invoked in water of any height
- Swimming up with the Jump button is faster
- There is a barrier at the water's surface that keeps the player swimming, rather than having the player stop swimming when at the surface
- Friction at the water's surface is lessened
This is controlled by the `legacySwimming` gamerule.

## TNT Limit
The `tntLimit` gamerule can be used to limit the amount of Primed TNT entites that can exist in a world. <br>
This is controlled with an integer value, and defaults to `20`

## Starter Map
`starterMap` controls whether or not new players will spawn with an Empty Map. <br>
This is controlled by a boolean, and defaults to `true`

## Starter Bundle
`starterBundle` controls whether or not new players will spawn with a Bundle item. <br>
This is controlled by a boolean, and defaults to `false`
