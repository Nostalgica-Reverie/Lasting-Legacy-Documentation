# Resource Pack Management

In Legacy4J, the way resource packs are managed has been largely overhauled to bring similar functionality to the Texture Packs system used in the Legacy Console Edition.

## Global Resource Packs

Global Resource Packs can be configured in a similar way as vanilla Resource Packs, but apply at the top (by default) of the overall resource pack order.

## Resource Albums

Resource Albums are like groups of resource packs that can be applied at once. Albums can be applied per-world (like on LCE), or as the default pack for new worlds if applied in the Graphics options on the main menu. These can also be applied through a World Template.

### Album Options
In `Album Options`, you can delete, edit and create new Resource Albums with a custom name and description.

For information on syntax of the `resource_albums.json`, see [Resource Album Syntax](/mods/legacy4j/resource-album-syntax)

## Ordering

If `globalPack1`/`globalPack2` were applied in Global Resource Packs, and `albumPack1`/`albumPack2` in the Resource Album, this would be the order of the applied Resource Packs:

```
globalPack1
globalPack2
albumPack1
albumPack2
```
However, if `globalPack2` were to be applied above `albumPack2` in the Resource Album, the new order would be this:
```
globalPack1
albumPack1
globalPack2
albumPack2
```
